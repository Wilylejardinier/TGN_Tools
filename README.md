Run the program. A window will appear with a text field and a button.

*2. In the text field, enter the format you want to use for the new folder names. You can use placeholders such as {artist}, {album}, {genre}, {date}, and {title} to include the corresponding metadata tags in the name.
Click the "Select directories" button to open the file browser.

*3. In the file browser, navigate to the directories you want to rename and select them. You can select multiple directories by holding down the Ctrl or Shift keys while selecting.

*4. Click the "Open" button to confirm your selection. The selected directories will be renamed according to the specified format.
